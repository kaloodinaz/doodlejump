##  Game Mechanics

- **Jumping physics**: The Doodler accelerates downward due to gravity, and landing on a platform propels it upward.
- **Platform variety**:
  - *Stable* — Standard platforms that stay in place.
  - *Crumbling* — Disappear after being stepped on.
  - *Moving* — Slide horizontally or vertically.
  - *Spring-loaded* — Give an extra boost when landed upon.
- **Power-ups & enemies**: From props like springs or propellers that elevate you higher to pesky enemies (if present) that you must dodge.
- **Score system**: Determined by the maximum altitude reached—see your high score on the leaderboard panel, if available.
